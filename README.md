# Milestone-project-1

How to play -

- You will be given a starter dialogue and will have to choose between multiple choices on trying to escape the woods alive. Each choice is given a unique story towards your journey home.

Thought process before starting the project -

I would like to make a role-playing game where the player will read parts of the story and make decisions along the way similarly to Dungeons & Dragons.

I would like this to be an adventure game where the player is lost in the woods and has to make the right decisions to escape the unknown challenges of the woods.

Some things I would like to have in my game -

- Have four buttons as choices for each decision the player has to make.
- Background music for the tone of the game.
- Background images for each question and for the document itself
- everytime a user clicks a button a sound effect goes off.
- have the game end in either a win or loss based on the choices of the player.
