# Milestone-project-1

Thought before starting the project -

I would like to make a role-playing game where the player will read parts of the story and make decisions along the way like Dungeons & Dragons or the stanly parable.
or
An adventure game wher ethe player is lost in the woods and has to make the right decisions to escape the scary vastness of the woods.

Some things I would like to have in my game -

- Have four buttons as choices for each decision the player has to make.
- Background music for the tone of the game.
- Background images for each question and for the document itself
- everytime a user clicks a button a sound effect goes off.
- have the game end in either a win or loss based on the choices of the player.
